# libSSD1306

Linux C++ library to drive an SSD1306 128x64 Oled display with I2C interface

This is the forked version, which I'm going to try to fix it to allow for 32 and 64 line displays.
Adafruit sells both sizes now, and having a C++ for the 32 pixel height would be nice.

More documentation to come if I get around to cleaning this up. It currently only sorta
displays, so there are still some issues, likely in the I2C command structure.
